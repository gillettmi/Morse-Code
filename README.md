# Morse-Code
This python script converts text in the `input.txt` file into morse code. The program file outputs both a text conversion in `output.txt` as well as an audio output using Windows' `winsound`.

# Dependencies
This program runs using Python 3. The script only runs on a Windows machine due to the `winsound` requirement. Besides that, there are no other dependencies required.

# How to use the program
Open up the `input.txt` file and type whatever you wish the program to convert in there. Keep in mind that only alpha-numeric characters will work. Everything else will throw an error.
After you're done typing the message, save the text file and run the morsecode.py program. It will take the input, convert it to a text file, and play the audio output through your default speakers.

# Issues
No bugs known at the moment, but feel free to send me a message if you encounter anything.
